Step back into the classic era of gaming with Snake! This project, born out of a traineeship where I combined my love for visual design with coding, aims to bring back the joy of old-school gameplay in a modern context.
<br/><br/>

## Overview

Snake offers a nostalgic journey reminiscent of arcade days. Navigate through challenges, gobbling up apples to grow longer. But be cautious: with each apple eaten, the game accelerates, testing your reflexes and strategic thinking.
<br/><br/>

## Features

- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys
- Randomly generated apples that increase snake length upon consumption
- Increased speed with each apple consumed
- (High) score tracking
- Game over detection upon collision with snake body
- Pause the game with the ESC key for a quick breather
- Press SPACE to change themes
- Restart the game after game over
<br/><br/>

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)
